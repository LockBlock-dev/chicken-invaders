### File header

The file begins with a 4-byte unsigned integer that specifies the number of assets contained in the file.

| Name  |     Type     | Size (bytes) |       Description       |
| :---: | :----------: | :----------: | :---------------------: |
| count | unsigned int |      4       | Number of asset entries |

### Asset header

Immediately following the file header are `count` asset headers. Each asset header is 88 bytes in length and contains metadata about a single asset.

|  Name  |     Type     | Size (bytes) |             Description              |
| :----: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------------------------------: |
|  name  |     char     |      80      |      Null-terminated asset name      |
| offset | unsigned int |      4       | Byte offset to the asset in the file |
|  size  | unsigned int |      4       |    Size of the the asset in bytes    |

### Asset data

Each assetâ€™s data is stored at the specified `offset` and is exactly `size` bytes long.
